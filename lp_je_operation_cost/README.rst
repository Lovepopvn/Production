LovePop – Journal Entries for Operation Cost
============================================

* Adds **Stock Valuation Account (Outgoing, Operation)** selection to Stock Location.
* The Journal Entry that is created for the newly created product when marking Manufacturing Order done is changed: its credit line is split to record the MO's Cost of Components and Cost of Operations separately, using the *Stock Valuation Account (Outgoing, Components)* for Components and the *Stock Valuation Account (Outgoing, Operation)* for Operations.
