LovePop – Landed Costs Rounding Fix
===================================

* Fixes Landed Costs' rounding error for JE.
* The Additional Landed Cost of Landed Costs' Valuation Adjustmens lines is rounded to 0 decimals.
* The last line of Valuation Adjustments has its Additional Landed Cost adjusted so the summation of all lines' Additional Landed Costs is equal to the sum of Additional Costs lines' Costs.
