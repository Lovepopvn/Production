LovePop – Inventory Rounding Difference
=======================================

Rounds product cost after AVCO valuation is processed.

* Adds account selection to Accounting Settings (company-specific).
* After *Transfer*'s validation, checks if the product cost has decimals, and if yes, updates the cost to a value with decimals removed (floored, not rounded).
